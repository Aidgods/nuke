# /__nuke

I've had this exploit in my hands since around July 2022, however, it's been known for around 2 years in a very old Pocketmine Github issue.

Personally, I've used this tool to shut down wannabe/P2W servers like Centile Kitmap and GreekHCF

This exploit will be patched soon! Be aware that it may not work after some time.

## Usage
I won't give formal step-by-step instructions on how to use it: Just install Go, `go run .`, login via the localhost proxy IP, and type `.nuke`. If you can't follow those instructions, you're probably too stupid to use this and/or a skid.
