I've had this exploit in my hands since around July 2022, however, it's been known for around 2 years in a very old Pocketmine Github issue.

Personally, I've used this tool to shut down wannabe/P2W servers like Centile Kitmap and GreekHCF

This exploit will be patched soon! Be aware that it may not work after some time.
